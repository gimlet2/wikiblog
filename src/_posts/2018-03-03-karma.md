Today I’ve come back to frontend project I’m involved. I have no idea what have happened while I was away for different things but our **Karma.js** tests stop&nbsp;working.

The project is done with **Vue.js** and it becomes for some reason impossible to pass slots to the components as strings. Well. And there was error message suggesting to use **Puppeteer** instead.
<!-- more -->
And here is a short snippet to how actually do that. Quick notice, I run my tests inside Docker container…

1. remove **Phantomjs** from your **package.json**
2. add dependencies to **puppeteer** and **karma-chrome-launcher**

3. update **karma.conf.js** according to the snippet&nbsp;below

```javascript
const webpackConfig = require('../../build/webpack.test.conf');
process.env.CHROME_BIN = require('puppeteer').executablePath();

module.exports = function (config) {
  config.set({
    // to run in additional browsers:
    // 1. install corresponding karma launcher
    //    http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/config/browsers.html
    // 2. add it to the `browsers` array below.
    browsers: ['Chrome_no_sandbox'],
    customLaunchers: {
      Chrome_no_sandbox: {
        base: 'Chrome',
        flags: [
          '--no-sandbox',
          '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
          '--headless',
          '--disable-gpu',
          '--remote-debugging-port=9222',
        ],
      },
    },
    frameworks: ['mocha', 'sinon-chai'],
    reporters: ['spec', 'coverage'],
    files: ['./index.js'],
    preprocessors: {
      './index.js': ['webpack', 'sourcemap'],
    },
    webpack: webpackConfig,
    webpackMiddleware: {
      noInfo: true,
    },
    client: {
      captureConsole: false,
    },
    coverageReporter: {
      dir: './coverage',
      reporters: [{ type: 'lcov', subdir: '.' }, { type: 'text-summary' }],
    },
  });
};
```

4. also **Chrome** requires some system libraries and doesn’t work on default **nodejs**  **Docker** image. So, I’ve found `geekykaran/headless-chrome-node-docker`.

And after all that changes my tests are green&nbsp;again!
